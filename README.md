#### Welcome! My name is Doug Andrade - I'm an active-duty U.S. Naval Flight Officer and an aspiring data scientist. 

Inspired by my William & Mary MBA, I continued to develop and grow my passion for machine learning, statistics, and decision modeling by immersing myself in a second Master of Science in Business Analytics at W&M and Data Science Certification at the Naval Postgraduate School.

In preparation for a military-to-civilian career transition, I have committed to continuous learning through self-inspired machine learning and data analytics projects, presented on my GitHub profile. My intentions is to further my proficiency in the field, gain experience in presenting my findings, and invite the attention of others who may learn from my experiences.
