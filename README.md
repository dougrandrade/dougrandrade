#### Welcome to my data analytics portfolio.

My goal is to continuously grow my proficiency in data science, employing practical techniques to real-world applications. I aim to engage the community through my work, sharing insights and findings to continue developing my understanding and application of data science.

My GitHub portfolio is a living series of projects that I have continuously mature and grow over time, relative to my balance of time between work, family, and self-study.

I focus on machine learning using R and Python:
- Convolutional neural network deep learning in Python with Keras and Tensorflow
- Time Series analysis in Python and R, with visualizations and interactive dashboards (matplotlib, ggplot, Shiny, etc)
- Graduate school data science projects in jupyter notebook format
