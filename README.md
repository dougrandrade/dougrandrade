#### Welcome to my data science portfolio.

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. I highlight a living series of practical applications and creative problem-solving across diverse domains in data science.

I focus on machine learning using R and Python:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Leveraging Python, Keras, and TensorFlow to tackle image classification, object detection, and more.
- Time Series Analysis: Utilizing Python and R for forecasting and trend analysis, accompanied by interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- Graduate School Projects: Presenting data science projects from my academic background, documented in Jupyter notebooks.

Driven to innovation and experimentation to progressively refine my expertise in data science. My goal is to engage with the community by sharing personal insights, methodologies, and lessons learned through my projects.

Feel free to reach out with any comments and/or questions!
