#### Welcome! I am Doug Andrade, an active-duty U.S. Naval Flight Officer enthusiastic about leveraging data science to drive insights and innovation.

During my time pursuing my William & Mary MBA (2021) and under the inspirational teaching of Professor Joe Wilck, I realized the power of machine learning and decision-modeling methods in extracting pragmatic insights from data. This passion led me to pursue further education, culminating in a W&M MS in Business Analytics (2023) and a Data Science Certificate from the Naval Postgraduate School (2024).


In my nearly two decades of Naval service, I've witnessed the transformative impact of data-driven decision-making across various domains, including Naval Aviation squadron training, ship's tactical communications evaluation, and advocacy for future technology investment.
My goal is to continuously enhance my proficiency in data science, applying practical techniques to real-world applications. Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase my journey and projects and engage with a community of like-minded individuals, sharing insights and experiences to collectively advance our understanding and application of data science.
