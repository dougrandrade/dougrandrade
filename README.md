### Welcome! I'm Doug Andrade, an active duty Naval Flight Officer in the U.S. Navy and an aspiring data scientist. 

As I approach two decades of service in the U.S. Navy, I am beginning to prepare myself for a pivot into the field of data science and business analytics.

Inspired by my William & Mary MBA, I continued to develop and grow my passions for machine learning, statistics, and decision modeling by imersing myself through a second Masters of Science in Business Analytics at W&M and Data Science Certification at the Naval Postgraduate School.

In my path toward preparing for a military to civilian career transition, I've commited to continuous learning via my self-inspired machine learning and data analytics projects, presented on my GitHub profile. The primary purpose of this effort is to further my own understanding and proficiency in the field, afford myself experience in summarizing and presenting my findings, and perhaps gain the attention of others who may learn from my personal education.
